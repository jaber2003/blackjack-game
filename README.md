# 🃏 Blackjack Game

This is a simple JavaScript project built as part of the **Scrimba Learn JavaScript** course.

The game simulates a basic version of Blackjack:
- Draw two random cards at the start.
- Draw additional cards if you want to get closer to 21.
- Try to get exactly 21 to win.
- If your total exceeds 21, you lose.
